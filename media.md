Doctors for Defunding Police started as a small initiative with a few MDs concerned about the toll anti-Black and anti-Indigenous policing was taking on the health of residents in the City of Toronto.

Our open letter was released on June 25, 2020. It was a public letter directed to Toronto City Council and Mayor John Tory.
